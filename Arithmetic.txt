. Addition (+)
The + operator is used to add two numbers or concatenate two strings.
python
a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print(result)  # Output: 8

2. Subtraction (-)
The - operator is used to subtract one number from another.
python
a = 5
b = 3
result = a - b
print(result)  # Output: 2

3. Multiplication (*)
The * operator is used to multiply two numbers.
python
a = 5
b = 3
result = a * b
print(result)  # Output: 15

4. Division (/)
The / operator is used to divide one number by another. This always returns a floating-point value, even if the result is a whole number.
python
a = 5
b = 2
result = a / b
print(result)  # Output: 2.5

5. Floor Division (//)
The // operator divides and returns the integer quotient, discarding the fractional part.
python
a = 5
b = 2
result = a // b
print(result)  # Output: 2

6. Modulus (%)
The % operator returns the remainder after division.
python
a = 5
b = 2
result = a % b
print(result)  # Output: 1

7. Exponentiation (**)
The ** operator is used to raise a number to the power of another number.
python
a = 5
b = 2
result = a ** b
print(result)  # Output: 25 (5^2)


Summary of Arithmetic Operators:
Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	                        5 + 3 = 8
-	Subtraction	                        5 - 3 = 2
*	Multiplication	                    5 * 3 = 15
/	Division	                        5 / 2 = 2.5
//	Floor Division (integer quotient)	5 // 2 = 2
%	Modulus (remainder)	                5 % 2 = 1
**	Exponentiation	                    5 ** 2 = 25
