In Python, relational (or comparison) operators are used to compare two values. 
These operators return either True or False based on the comparison result. 
Here are the relational operators in Python:

1.Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
5 == 5  # True
5 == 3  # False


2.Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
5 != 3  # True
5 != 5  # False

3.Greater than (>): Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
5 > 3  # True
3 > 5  # False

4.Less than (<): Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
3 < 5  # True
5 < 3  # False

5.Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
5 >= 3  # True
3 >= 5  # False
5 >= 5  # True

6.Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.
3 <= 5  # True
5 <= 3  # False
5 <= 5  # True

These operators are commonly used in conditional statements
and loops to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.
